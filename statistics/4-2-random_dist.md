[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Exercise 2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to 
be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. 
Is the distribution uniform?

>> ```python
import numpy as np

>> import nsfg
>> import first
>> import thinkstats2
>> import thinkplot
```

>> create a list of 1000 random numbers
>> ```python 
>> r = np.random.random(1000)
```

>> create Pmf of list of random numbers to show the probability of each number choosen
>>```python
>> pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(r, 'Random Numbers')
```
>> plot the Pmf
>>```python
>> thinkplot.PrePlot(1)
>> thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf])
>> thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Number', ylabel='PDF')
```

>> create cumulative distribution function (CDF) to map froma value to its percentile rank
>> ```python
>> cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(r)
```
>> Graph the Cdf
>> ```python
>> thinkplot.PrePlot(1)
>> thinkplot.Cdfs([cdf])
>> thinkplot.Show(xlabel= 'Random Number', ylabel='CDF')
```
>> ![Graph](https://github.com/anaelisagentle/dsp/blob/master/img/chap04_Cdf_graph.png)

>> The CDF is approximately a straight line, which means that the distribution is uniform. What this figure shows is that 10% of the sample is below the 10th percentile, 20% is below the 20th percentile, and so on, exactly as we should expect.
